In ‘[The Creative Writer and Daydreaming](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-uncanny-sigmund-freud/3738687)’, Freud argues that creative writing is a warped extension of childhood play. That sense of play, in adulthood, is infused with shame – nobody wants to be as vulnerable and helpless as a child. They want the joy of childhood but not the vulnerability, neediness, or lack of control. So play, via shame, becomes fantasy, which we are inclined to protect and keep hidden, perhaps out of fear of being taken advantage of or ridiculed. The daydream is a more palatable version of the fantasy. The daydream, like a work of fiction, stitches time together: it provides a scenario in which a current desire – motivated by a past desire – creates space for wish fulfilment. You keep living, or keep reading, to find out whether the desire does or does not get fulfilled in the future. You have to be invested in life, or the story, enough to see whether the wish comes true.
