### ü§† Hey!
I'm Annie. I've been using Obsidian for some time, and in the process of importing my notes onto this public digital garden. I believe in living life with bright eyes & a playful attitude, toeing the line between taking yourself too seriously & irreverence, and oversharing is always better than otherwise. Slow down, enjoy yourself as you wade through my mental headspace.
