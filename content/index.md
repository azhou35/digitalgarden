### ü§† Hey!
I'm Annie. I've been using Obsidian as my note-taking system since November 2024. I have a separate vault for my quickest notes, and then I periodically will transfer them to this public-facing repository. I write on Substack [here](https://anniewhere.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile)!

### What do I like to do?
* Street photography -- see [[Photography Starter Guide]], or [[street photography]]
* Writing -- see why I write at [[ars poetica]]. Or, my withering [[Backlog of things to write about]]

### Collections
* Movies: [Letterboxd ‚Ä¢ Social film discovery.](https://letterboxd.com/)
* Songs: https://open.spotify.com/user/kokorodamasu?si=0571e34c32494578
