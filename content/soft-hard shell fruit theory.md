every relationship is either a soft shell or hard shell fruit
* soft shell, soft inside - fuyu persimmons - burst at the seams
	* aka you make me feel so much and i feel so close to you i will literally overflow with conversation
	* raspberries - the most tender fruit that still needs to be hand-picked
* hard shell, soft inside - pomegranates
	* harder to crack, but when it opens its jolting and surprising 
	* bananas - also burst at the open, but the hard shell makes it mushy and leak out weirdly 
		* regardless of a hard shell, if my feelings are left to rot inside, they will inevitably spill out 
		* i am embarassed when i hold in my emotions too long and they inevitably ooze out 

forgive me, the mess i reveal of myself at ripening.
