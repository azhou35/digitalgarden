as a remote worker i enjoy hanging at cafes. it facilitates the feeling of ambient co-presence that i otherwise miss out on when i stick to my home office. 

maggie appleton describes the idea of ambient copresence: the "sense of ambiently sharing space - of being co-present - while engaged in other activities" which serves as a staple of shared public spaces. 

it's a type of social interaction that cuts different than meeting up with a friend 1:1 to hang out, or going to a party. it's a soft blanket, some shared air amongst a group of people that acknowledges that *we are all in this together*.
