there is no city in the united states with a higher density of talent, art, industry, and culture as new york. culture, as ill-defined as the term may be, is defined in the city. there's such a high standard for fashion & food that it's guaranteed you'll be surrounded by the most relevant and trendy options. the zeitgeist of america will be defined on these streets. 

i grew up in a family with their house in new jersey and their heart in the city; visiting every saturday in high school; bussing from upstate new york half of my semester. it was the last of those weekly city visits, april my junior year, when i squatted in east village night-capping a budget omakase with fried oreos from ray's and watched the going out crowd flit by -- it was in that moment i committed to finally moving to the city. 

living in nyc pairs nicely with a high [[permeability to wonder]].

people have written a million love letters to new york, via song, poetry, substacks, books, movie scenes. allow me to pile on more sap.
