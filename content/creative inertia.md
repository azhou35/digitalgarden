forked from [[spring notes on creativity]]
how do you value art?
- aesthetic value
-- its never lost -- it gets transferred from person to person
potential energy --> kinetic energy
art is a vessel of so much potential -- 
* how do you determine "art" vs "content"?
* curation is super important to me
* content overload -- advertising, tik tok, etc
* curation going to museums, scrolling thru internet museums
going thru a museum
(notes on creativity)
* anecdotes:
	* i get more inspired to create when im with other "creative" people
	* curious by the term "creator" vs "creative" vs "artist"
		* i remember debating w my friend in dc -- do ppl in nyc term themselves as creative vs artist?
		* there's a level of cultural production that we aim to uphold
there's a level of ()gatekeeping that comes to art
i dont want to to restrict creativity 
but at the same time curation necessitates some sort of craft / cull / intention
* we're trying to remix each other's artwork
* originality vs creativity vs authenticity
	* originality and creativity are not necessarily tied to each other
	* "steal like an artist"
* we are constantly remixing each other
	* i think thats why tik tok does so well - we hop onto trends and create without pressure of originality
	* to me its not satisfying -- this is why it's termed *creator*, not creative
even reviews are a bit of art of in of itself
