*in response to a good friend's thesis*

* existentially interested by identity formation in content creation & consumption -- if it we form our identities around the things we consume (see: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://evilfemale.substack.com/p/personal-style-is-dead-and-the-algorithm?s%3Dr%26curius%3D1299,2184,562,2441&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1721748930166978&usg=AOvVaw1xaGHt2jT5V9DkKd2Pp7N_) OR the things we create -- and it becomes easier to both consume and create generic content -- how does that affect the way we live authentically on the internet?

* curation-as-a-service
	* my intuition is a batch of curation apps rise in response to content overload
	* next-gen curation tools: are.na, curius, pinterest, cosmos, twitter 
		* ai can't directly define "good taste," just what's popular and well-responded to. i still trust recs from internet friends > recommendation algorithms (which is lowkey my normie irl friends)
		* aka there's a bunch of shit on the internet -- how do we cut thru and find the good shit 
		* i also think there's a consumption <-> curation <-> creation feedback loop, with most ppl consumers 
			* curating is how you actively engage w the content u consume, and i curate with the intention of creating something in response to it 
* ai in the creative loop

	* how do we leverage ai to *help* our creation process rather than *replace* it entirely? 
		* from my exp in the graphic design program @ copenhagen, a lot of traditional artists are (justifiably) distrustful & look down upon gen ai output. totes valid. but then my professor made us use gen ai to help us create characters for a story. 
		* i actually rlly enjoy using ai chatbots to help me brainstorm idea (e.g. asking dot how to visualize my friend graph)

	* ai within established creative tools

* ai content general use case vs specific verticals
	* [Bruno Koba on X: "I've been investigating vertical AI startups profoundly for the past few weeks. I think we're in a very strange part of the cycle in AI startup funding/development.

	* [Garry Tan on X: "I don’t think it’s too late to enter almost any software market with an LLM-powered alternative if you want to. We are seeing tiny teams of a few people build valuable software leapfrogging incumbents with even today’s frontier models (get enterprise sales) The war will be" / X](https://x.com/garrytan/status/1815057892489511259) 
	* "war on retention"
	* you prob have way more expertise to speak on this HAHH
* disruption of the publication industry /my personal aspirations
	* im rllyy curious by the future of content honestly. im trying to see the long term vision of my writing passion and idt it's writing a book. is it becoming a think piece writer? short-form content creator? 
	* i think there's some next-gen end goal for writers. and i think we need to ride the early wave! 
	* aligns with the *new types of content* -- i think static words is not enough for me but idk what it is
		* ai is revitalizing generic content -- [ChatGPT Is About to Write BuzzFeed Content - and Investors Love It - Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-stock-buzzfeed-layoffs-jobs-investors-economy-recession-markets-meta-2023-1)
		* https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666954423000194?curius=3996
		* -> in these two studies (prob biased) ai-generated content is great at maximizing consumer engagement numbers (prob bc engagement can be "gamed" -- humans are monkey brain and like patterns, which is perfect for algorithms)
			* im struggling to articulate how to measure/optimize for "meaningful" // identity-based // non-generic content. like content that makes me actively engage and think instead of passively scroll and consume. e.g. substack content
			* a random question i have: can ai form / interpret metaphors?
				* [[metaphors]] [[llms x language]]
				* in “Metaphors We Live By”, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson* argue that metaphors aren’t just poetic or rhetorical flourishes, but fundamental elements of human thought and language.
					* so rabbit-holey but llms excel at language but linguists contend they are not models of thought 
						* succeed at *formal competence*, generating meaningful and coherent texts, but fail at *functional *compoetence
