on the last day of june the city sweats itself sticky. 
something intoxicating about the dampness that precedes thunderstorm.
humidity-entrenched, understand why some call air a *medium*â€”feel 
her cling to you as second skin as you trudge through her body. you 
who comes alive at the touch of skin: heat of bodily other at last 
night's rave, harmonic tension and bated breath 'tween strangers. 

as of late, you've been wading with storms on your mind, the ocean's demise in your eyes. sultry secret pressed to your lips. so keen on thinking of space you've forgotten about time. 

rain is summer's sweet serenade, 
*sera* meaning evening, 
*sereno* meaning open air,
*serenata* meaning clear sky. 
serenade meaning 
				we have to say goodbye, you who breathes
				so much air you could only exist now. breeze
				so heavy it demands release. by morning 
				we will unspool a tad, by morrow 
sky runs stale again. 
just as the storm, you too, will pass.
